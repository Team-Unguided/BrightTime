BrightTime
=============================================================================
BrightTime adjusts your Android screen's brightness based on the time of day.
This [improves your phone's battery life](http://www.wired.com/2013/04/does-decreased-brightness-increase-your-phones-battery-life/).
Other projects like [Backlight!](http://www.phoeniix.com/android/backlight) make it easier to manually adjust your brightness settings to save power, but BrightTime completely automates this process.
Your phone will know the optimal brightness setting and adjust it for you.
The default install is suitable for most users, but advanced users can thoroughly customize the schedule.

`BrightTime` is easy to use.
Just [click here](http://d-h.st/Ddo) to install.
Currently, BrightTime requires **Android 5.0.2+**.

### Adjusting the schedule

BrightTime comes with default settings that should be good enough for most users.
Advanced users can follow these directions to change your settings.

* To create a "point" (a preset [I don't know what this means]):
    - tap on the `+`, the circular pink button at the center bottom of the screen.
    - Select your desired time and brightness.
    - Once finished, click the `Confirm` button. **Point added!**
    - You will return to the main screen where your added point will appear on the list by time.
    - Your screen brightness will now change according to the brightness and times you have set.
* To edit/delete a "point":
    - tap on the point you have created previously.
    - delete the point altogether using the `Delete` button.
    - modify any settings for that point and press `Confirm` to save changes.
    - to discard and go back, tap your `Back` button at either the top or bottom of your screen.

### Future Goals
* Allow users to `Undo` changes or deletion of their points.
* Clean up UI, icon, and code to fit [Google's design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) and [Code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html). 
* Support more Android versions.
