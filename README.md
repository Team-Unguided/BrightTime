BrightTime `com.unguided.BrightTime`
=============================================================================
### Initial Development: Nexus 5 (hammerhead) on Android 5.0.2
### Description
`BrightTime` (aka `Timed Brightness`) is an open-source application that will allow users to adjust their screen brightness settings according to the time of day. It is tailored to users who have rigid schedules throughout the week and provide more control of display settings than the existing Adaptive Brightness option. This will hopefully increase battery life and provide more functionality to device displays (which consumes the majority of battery life). 

### Usage
`BrightTime` is a simple-to-use application. Installation onto the device is automatic.
* To use the application, tap on the `+`, the circular pink button at the center bottom of the screen.
* Select your desired time and brightness.
* Once finished, click the `Confirm` button.
* You will return to the main screen where your added "point" will appear on the list by time.
* Your screen brightness will now change according to the brightness and times you have set.

### Future Implmentations
* Add an `Edit Point` page, where time, days-of-week, and brightness can be edited.
* Add `Delete Point` option
* Clean up UI, icon, and code to fit [Google's design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) and [Code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).
